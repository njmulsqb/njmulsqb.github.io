  Back in October 2020 I watched Social Dilemma (A Netflix Documentary) on the
  recommendation of a friend, it was a documentary made on side effects of
  social media and those side effects were mentioned by none other than the
  manufacturers of those tech giants, people holding executive positions,
  engineering positions in Facebook, Google, YouTube, Pinterest, etc explained
  how social media is becoming a social dilemma of this century. I won't go into
  detail about that documentary, but this documentary ignited a spark within me.

    In response to The Social Dilemma, I've made lots of changes to my internet
    routine, one of it is, shifting to
    <a href="https://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DuckDuckGo</a>
    with <a href="https://twitter.com/firefox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@firefox</a>,
    it's way better than Google if you consider privacy. Must give it a try!

  I started questioning the role of social media in our lives, I won't say
  social media is all bad, but the way it has been designed, most of us get
  hooked to it without even us being knowing it. I started discussing it with my
  friends and one of them suggested me to watch the "Snowden" movie as it
  reveals much more about the evil faces of these tech giants and government
  surveillance.
</p>
<p>
  I would highly recommend you to watch this movie. Snowden is a story of a hero
  named "Edward Snowden" who worked in NSA(National Security Agency), he saw
  there that the government is doing wrong by invading the privacy of all the
  users, they have got encryption keys from tech giants and they can access and
  see all your emails, texts, photos and any other sensitive media of yours. His
  story is very interesting and you should give it some time if you're serious
  about your privacy.<br />
</p>
<p>
  The government could use the mic and camera of your phone and laptop and can
  see you anytime without your consent. It was horrible, meaning that most of
  our conversations are online now, and because every conversation you make,
  every photo you share, every call you make is being listened to and observed
  carefully is really not acceptable for anyone of us.
</p>
<p>
  After searching more and more on this, watching movies, reading articles,
  listening to podcasts, I decided to bring a change in my online life.
</p>
<p>
  I started to bring drastic changes like avoiding Google as much as I can, I
  shifted to <a href="http://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> as
  my primary search engine, it felt awkward for a couple of days but then it was
  just like I am using Google. DuckDuckGo produced great search results and it
  stored none of my information and my searches. I dived deeper into the privacy
  settings of my Google account and disabled many privacy-invading settings that
  were unknown to me previously.
</p>

<br />&nbsp;<br />I left using Google Photos, backed up my sensitive data from
Google Drive as well.
<p>
  Now come to the browser, I was using Google Chrome as my main browser but
  after all this, I have to say goodbye to it as well. I installed
  <a href="http://firefox.com" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a> in all of my
  operating systems including desktop and mobile.
  <a href="http://brave.com" target="_blank">Brave browser</a> is my secondary
  browser. Both of these browsers are privacy-focused and don't tracks you
  around and stores your personal information.
</p>
<p>
  I made the transition towards encrypted email providers, the best of them was
  <a href="http://protonmail.com" target="_blank">Protonmail</a> and I use
  Protonmail as my professional email now instead of Gmail, I tried
  <a href="http://tutanota.com" target="_blank">Tutanota</a> as well but I think
  they need to work a lot on their service yet. ProtonMail is a mature and
  feature-rich service.
</p>
<p>
  <br />I backed up most of my private data into physical external drives and
  encrypted them so there's no chance left for data leakage from there. If and
  only if I still need to use cloud storage for private data, I use
  <a href="http://mega.nz" target="_blank">Mega</a> for it. Mega stores your
  data in encrypted form and they can't check your data so this is my cloud
  storage these days. Though ProtonMail is also planning to introduce their
  cloud service in the future, actually they're trying to provide an alternative
  to Google by providing services like mail, calendar, VPN, etc I might consider
  buying their subscription in the future as well. I use extensions like
  DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials, Privacy Badger, Ublock, etc that help me
  protect myself from trackers spread all over the internet.
</p>

<p>
  The most challenging part was leaving Whatsapp because all of my contacts used
  WhatsApp so I was going to face difficulties after deleting it but to be
  honest, it was just fear and nothing else. Obviously, I was doing months
  before the notorious whatsapp policy got revealed and everyone started to
  migrate to Signal and Telegram (That policy was just a highlight of how your
  data is being used and sold by corporations and intelligence agencies). As
  soon as I deleted Whatsapp, people who wanted to contact me found other
  alternatives and there was no hindrance in the communication.
</p>
<p>
  For chat and messaging, I completely avoid text messages and I use
  <a href="http://signal.org" target="_blank">Signal</a> and
  <a href="http://telegram.org">Telegram</a> now for personal messaging. Both of
  these apps are amazing, my personal favorite is Signal, it's open-source and
  is supported through donations, I use it daily and it's also being used by
  many of the privacy-conscious people including Edward Snowden. <br />

    Elizabeth Denham, the UK Information Commissioner for its independent
    privacy authority (ICO), was asked by a member of parliament if she uses
    WhatsApp or Facebook (no) and what she uses instead (Signal).<br /><br />Just
    goes to show that leaving the FB is a lot easier than leaving the EU.

  As a matter of fact, I have also put a tape on my laptop's camera 😂, you
  might think it to be too extremist but if you take a deep dive into the world
  of mass surveillance and data privacy you'll come to know how exposed we are
  and how important these steps are.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  I am much more confident about my online presence now, I don't use Facebook or
  any of its products like Whatsapp, Instagram, etc. My online presence is much
  more secure and private now and hopefully, after all these steps, some of my
  data will be secure if not all.
</p>
<p>
  If you think, you need any sort of guidance related to this post, I am always
  available. This online privacy topic is huge and there are tons of articles
  available online which you can read if you're interested in it. I just
  highlighted the choices I made within these few months and loved every bit of
  it. Peace 💓<br />
